## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Or goal is to help the user in achivieng a succesfull kickstarter campaign for their theater play. We'll achieve the goal by analysing the data of several kickstarter campaings, filtering several conditions that contribuited to successfull campaings, map the common factors of these successful campaigns.

We will analyse 2 main factor contributing to a sucessful campaing:
1. Outcomes based on Launch Date.
2. Outcomes based on Goals.

We want to have a clear overview of the when the campaings launched, that we we can know wich is the best monthn to have a successful campaign. Also we intend to analyse the data based in goals, to have a insight in the subcategory plays, to see if there is a relation between the amount thais is goal and the success the campaign had.

With these outcomes we can really help the user to have better in thee campaing for their play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As previously mentioned, we analysed the data based in Launch date. As we can see in the graph below, successful campaings tend to be grouping in the middle of the year. We start in january having 56 succesfull campaigns. We can see trend startig to rise from april, spiking on may with 111 successful, and slowly decreasing from may to october, when we can see we have 59 successful campaigns. We can see a little spike in october, rising from 59 to 65 successful campaigns, followed by a dunk in november with 54 successful campaigns and the lowest point is in december, with 37 successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We can see by the outcomes of data based in goals that the higher the goal, the lower the success rate. With the graph bellow, we can see the success reate tend to start higher, with 76% success rate in the "lower than 1,000" and decreasing slowly to the "20,000 to 24,999" with a 45% rate. Then we have a dunk in the "25,000 to 29,999" with only a 20% success rate. We have a rise in the "35,000 to 39,999" and "40,000 to 44,999" range, having a 67% success rate in both points. Then we hace a dunk to 0% success rate in the "45,000 to 49,000", slowly rising to 13% success rate in the "Greater than 50,000" range, having only 2 sucesful campaigns. We can see the opposite behavior in the failed rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main challenge I encountered was populating the "Outcome Based in Goals" Worksheet, however I was able to solve with the resources available and created the graph with no problem.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - My conslusion is that the best time to launch is between May and july when we have a high number of successful campaigns.
  - Another colcusion suports the idea of having the campaign launched between may and july, having relatevly low failed campaigns comapred to successful ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - My conslusion is that based on the data, is that campaigns with a less ambitious gaol, tend to perform better. Also we can see a rise in the 35,000 to 45,00 goal. My recomendation is to set a goal between lower than 15,000 or ranged between 35,000 to 45,000, depening on the user's need, to ensure a higher success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  The main limitations of the dataset, based on my experience will be:
    - A very important indicor would be if the user had ony toher successful capmapigns.
    - Other data that culd be helpful would be the demographics of the backersm to see if certain types of backers support toher plays like the user's play.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - I would create a graph displaying the length of the capmaign vs % of the pleaded amount to see the relation between the lenght of the campaing and the pleaded percentage of the campaign.
